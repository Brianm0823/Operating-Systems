Programming Assignment 1


Compile using the following: 

g++ PA1.cpp lex.yy.c -o PA1

Run using the following:

./PA1 inputCommands.txt input.txt


I used lex to parse the input files so lex.l, lex.yy.c, and scanner.h are all included. I used the following tutorial as a base and edited it extensively to work with my code.

I have written comments throughout my program explaining what my code does.
